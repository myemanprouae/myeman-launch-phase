## 1. Overview

This document outlines the contingency plan for the first month of MyEman's launch, focusing on staff absence and system failures with the current team of 5 members.

## 2. Staff Absence Coverage

| Absent Person | Primary Backup | Secondary Backup | Notes |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| **Mahfoud**   | Bashar         | -                | Bashar takes over all Sales & Ops. |
| **Bashar**    | Mahfoud        | -                | Mahfoud takes over all Sales & Ops. |
| **Zain**      | Eman           | Mahfoud          | Eman handles all CSR. Mahfoud is backup. |
| **Eman**      | Zain           | Bashar           | Zain handles all CSR. Bashar is backup for PRO. |
| **Hussein**   | -              | -                | Escalate to New Horizon CFO. |

## 3. System & Operational Failures

| Scenario | Immediate Action | Responsible |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| **CS CRM Down** | Use shared Excel sheets (Google Drive). Manually log all interactions. | **Mahfoud** |
| **Payment Gateway Down** | Use direct bank transfer. Send bank details manually. | **Hussein** |
| **Email System Down** | Use WhatsApp for urgent client communication. | **All Staff** |
| **WhatsApp Business Down** | Use direct calls and email for communication. | **All Staff** |
| **Vendor Not Responding** | Contact vendor urgently. If no response within 2 hours, reassign to backup vendor. | **Bashar / Mahfoud** |
| **Client Complaint** | Listen, apologize, and log in CRM. Escalate to Mahfoud. | **Zain / Eman** |

## 4. Key Risks for Launch Phase

- **Team Burnout:** With shared responsibilities, the workload on Mahfoud and Bashar will be high. This needs to be monitored daily.
- **Single Point of Failure:** Eman is the only internal PRO. If she is unavailable, all labor services will be delayed.
- **Vendor Reliability:** Heavy reliance on external vendors for most services. A poor-performing vendor can significantly impact client satisfaction.
